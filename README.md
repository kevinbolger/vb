# vba

## Description
Visual Basic for Applications projects/code snippets

This repository will include some sample vba projects/snippets that I have developed.

The intention is to demonstrate my capabilities at implementing vba.

I will attempt to break up code snippets from my projects which I believe could be generically applied to anyones vba projects.

The projects themselves are not explicitly intended to be copied (not that it would prohibited - just the applications are usually bespoke in their requirements).
