## Description
Visual Basic projects/code snippets

This repository will include some sample vb projects/snippets that I have developed. For the most part, my VB projects are based on VBA for MS Office. 

The intention is to demonstrate my capabilities at implementing vba. 

I will attempt to break up code snippets from my projects which I believe could be generically applied to anyones vba projects though the projects themselves are not explicitly intended to be copied (not that it would prohibited - just the applications are usually bespoke in their requirements).
